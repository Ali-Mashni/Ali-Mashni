## Software Engineering × Cybersecurity

Engineering-first background in software development with a concentration in cybersecurity. 

### Focus areas
- Secure software development (threat modeling mindset, secure patterns, and safer-by-default implementations)
- Web and application security testing (validation, exploitation in lab setups, and remediation-oriented notes)
- Defensive monitoring and detection (log analysis, basic detection logic, dashboards)
- Cryptography & blockchain (applied crypto concepts, smart contracts, and verification flows)
- Data privacy (privacy-aware design choices and data handling practices)

### Tools I’m comfortable with 
- **Web/AppSec:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, ffuf
- **Network/Security testing:** Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit (lab environments)
- **Host/AD & assessment:** BloodHound, LinPEAS (as needed)
- **Monitoring/SIEM:** Splunk (searches, dashboards, basic detections)
- **Engineering:** Docker, Linux, Git/GitHub, CI workflows

### Tech stack
- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, C/C++, Solidity
- **Backend & APIs:** FastAPI, Node.js/Express
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB

### Exploring
- Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and the math foundations needed to reason about it
- Security of serverless and modern cloud-native application patterns
