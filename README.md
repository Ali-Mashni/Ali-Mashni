## What I’m working on

- **Security engineering practice (hands-on):** pen testing labs, web security, network analysis, and defensive hardening with clear writeups and evidence
- **PrivPrompt (Private AI Session Firewall):** MV3 extension → local proxy → dashboard for redaction, blocking policies, and local observability (JSONL + metrics)
- **Attack & Defense Security Lab:** end-to-end workflow (recon → exploit → SIEM analysis → mitigation) with Splunk detections and hardening recommendations
- **Applied blockchain systems:** Solidity smart contracts + testnet deployments + transaction verification (Etherscan) and QR-based verification flows
- **Professional baseline:** finishing **Security+** and consolidating core domains (network security, IAM, incident response, security operations)
- **Engineering discipline:** clean architecture, automated tests, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized development for reproducible projects
